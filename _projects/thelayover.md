				<h2>About {{page.title}}</h2>
				<div>
					<p>
            As a millennial, I love traveling around the world. Learning and exploring new cultures and experiencing life in foreign lands broadens my perception on who I am and what I can do for society. However, as a millennial, budgetary concerns is always on my mind. In order to satisfy these cravings within my financial means, I've booked some ridiculous flights which made it seem like my layovers were more like my intended destination. In my last trip, I've been stuck in an airport for 15 hours and due to some booking complications. Despite how gruesome it may seemed, I've spent a good deal of time in the airport creating this app. From one traveler to another, I introduce you to the layover.
          </p>
          <p>
            The layover is a destination discovery tool aimed to provide travelers suggested places to visit within the timeframe of their layover. This project is still in development. Stay tune for more updates.
